## ✈️ Packing Tips

- **Layer, don’t overpack:** Each new city is colder — add layers instead of new outfits.  
- **Laundry once:** Plan to wash clothes mid-trip (e.g., in Seoul or Busan).  
- **Compression bags or cubes:** Save luggage space.  
- **Neutral palette:** Black, navy, beige, gray = mix & match easily.  
- **Leave space for shopping:** Especially for Korean / Japanese fashion finds.  
- **Check forecasts:** Verify temps again before departure.  
- **Evenings matter:** Coastal cities (Busan, Fukuoka) can feel colder due to wind.

---

✅ **Summary**
- Warm → cold progression: start light in Hong Kong, end bundled in Fukuoka.  
- Bring 1 heavy coat, 2 sweaters, 1 jacket, and multiple light layers.  
- Accessories (scarf, gloves, hat) will extend warmth without bulk.  
- You’ll be fully covered for comfort from ~25 °C → 5 °C.
